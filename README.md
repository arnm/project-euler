# Project Euler

These are my solutions to the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net)
problem set. 

## Disclaimers

I'm not a mathematician.

These solutions are in no way the "best" solutions but they should be
readable and easy to understand.

### Python Solutions

The Python solutions need to executed with Python 3.

### JavaScript (NodeJS) Solutions

These solutions were written for use in NodeJS with a focus on utilizing
the [lodash](http://lodash.com) utility library.
